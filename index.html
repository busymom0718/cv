        <p><em>Web Developer</em></p>
        <p>I am new to coding and web development. For the last five years, I have taught high school English. However, with the changing politics in education, the joy of teaching has been sucked out. For a while, I had been trying to figure out
          what else
          I could do besides teach. Until finally, a Facebook ad came across my newsfeed about learning to code and becoming a software developer. So I began reading into it. The more I read and learned, the more interested and excited I became. Now,
          here
          I am, learning to code and be a web developer. I have finally found something that has reignited my spark, and I can't wait to see what comes next in this journey.</p>
